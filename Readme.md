# gollyx--pelican

This branch contains the template for the pelican repo.
The pelican repo contains definitions of all the pages
that show up on a Cup's page (league, simulator, maps, etc.).

This repo does not define the style, navigation bar, or any
page templates. Those are defined in the `gollyx--pelican-theme`
cookie cutter template.
