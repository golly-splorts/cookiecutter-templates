# zappa--api

This repo contains a cookie cutter template for a directory
containing a Zappa lambda function with the Golly API.

This is not a cookie cutter template for an entire repo,
but rather for a subdirectory that should be added to
the [gollyx-cloud](https://github.com/golly-splorts/gollyx-cloud) repo.
